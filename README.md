# Data Readiness for Natural Language Processing

This document concerns **data readiness** in the context of machine learning and **Natural Language Processing**. It describes 
how an organization may proceed to identify, make available, validate, and prepare data to facilitate automated 
analysis methods. 

The contents of the document is based on the practical challenges and frequently asked questions we 
(NLU group at [RISE](https://ri.se)) have encountered in our work as an applied research institute with helping 
organizations and companies, both in the  public and private sectors, to use data in their business processes.

The purpose of this document is to describe how an organization may proceed to identify, make available, validate, and prepare 
data to facilitate automated analysis methods (machine learning, natural language processing).
